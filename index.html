						<h2>Current: (Oct. 2020 - Sep. 2021)</h2>
						<p>I am currently a MSc student in 
							<A HREF = "https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/taught-degrees/computational-statistics-machine-learning-msc">
								Computational Statistics and Machine Learning</A>, where I am studying exciting topics in <strong>statistical modeling</strong>
								 and <strong>machine learning</strong> from both theory and application aspects.
								 I am listing out courses that I am currently enjoying. 
							 Unfortunately, I am not able to display any codes since they are still in marking process. But I hope these narratives will give you a better idea of 
							 what potential I will be having as a student.

							<h3><A HREF = "https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/supervised-learning/COMP0078">
								COMP0078 Supervised Learning</A></h3>
							<p>The course covers a range of supervised classification algorithms from both mathematical driven and computing practical approaches: 
								linear regressions, K-NN, Kernelisation, Decision trees, Multi-task learning and Online learning, etc. I enjoyed the most are the thinking process of
								learning the equality and inequality proofs, such as: bias and variance trade off, boosting convergence and Hedge bound. This type of abstract trainning 
								are relatively new but are absolutely interesting to me . I wish to continue learning to think trough careful formulation, thorough manipulation, and being able to answer questions in both theoretical and practical ways.

								COMP0090 Introduction to Deep Learning</A></h3>
							<p>Perceptron algorithm and its deeper architecture: MLP, RNN, LSTM, (CNN) are probabity the most common topics for Deep Learning at a introductary level. As a engineering students who 
								has some background in neuroscience, the astonishment for me is the parallelism in functionality between Neuron Networks and our brain nowadays. The input information to our brain are seemlying random electrical 
								stimuli, but the meaningful output from our brain is that we can see, feel and perform actions. Although the biological inspired Neuron Networks have yet achieved the percision and efficiency of our 
								brain, the existence of the comtemporary sophisticated Neuron Networks are already a proof of the accumulation of passion, creation and persistence in research community, generation by generation.
