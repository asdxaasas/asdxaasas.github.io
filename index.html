						<h2>Current: (Oct. 2020 - Sep. 2021)</h2>
						<p>I am currently a MSc student in 
							<A HREF = "https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/taught-degrees/computational-statistics-machine-learning-msc">
								Computational Statistics and Machine Learning</A>, where I am studying exciting topics in <strong>statistical modeling</strong>
								 and <strong>machine learning</strong>: both theory and applications.
								 I am listing out courses that I am currently enjoying. 
							 Unfortunately, I am not able to display any codes since they are still being marked. But I hope these narratives will give you a better idea of 
							 my potential as a PhD student.

							<h3><A HREF = "https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/supervised-learning/COMP0078">
								COMP0078 Supervised Learning</A></h3>
							<p>The course covers a range of supervised classification algorithms from theoretical and practical computing approaches: 
								Linear regressions, K-NN, Kernelisation, Decision trees, Multi-task learning and Online learning, etc. </p>
							<p>What I enjoyed: rigorous proofs and thought process for bias and variance trade off, boosting convergence and Hedge bound.</p>
							<p>In the future: I wish to be able to formulate and solve problems in theoretical and practical ways.</p>
							<p>Programming Languages: Matlab</p>
						</div>
						<div class="plainbox">
							<h3><A HREF = "https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/graphical-models/COMP0080">
								COMP0080 Graphical Models</A></h3>
							<p>The course covers directed and undiredcted graphical models, HMM, Junction Trees as well as probabilistic inference algorithms 
								for aforementioned models, such as, forward-backward recursion, sum-product algorithm, naive Bayes, EM algorithm and Baum-Welch algorithm.</p>
							<p>What I enjoyed: employing Bayes' theorem and constructing graphical representations of an event allow us to infer and to learn
								the most probable unobservable past, current and future.</p>
							<p>In the future: I wish to obtain maturity in Bayesian inference and be able to apply and to advance it in real-world applications,
							   hence contributing to the discovery of the unobservable truth.</p>
							<p>Programming Languages: Julia, Matlab</p>
						</div>
						<div class="plainbox">
							<h3><A HREF = "https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/introduction-to-deep-learning/COMP0090">
								COMP0090 Introduction to Deep Learning</A></h3>
							<p>The course covers topics ranging from single perceptron algorithm to its deeper architecture: MLP, RNN, LSTM, (CNN), attention</p>
							<p>What I enjoyed: As a engineering student with some neuroscience background, I enjoyed to discover the parallelism in 
								functionality between neural networks and our brain. Using mathematics and computations,
								the former is approaching ATP-powered brain year by year.
							</p>
							<p>In the future: I wish to join a research community, which is passionate, creative and persistent, contributing to the 
								to advancement of the current state-of-the-art human-inspired technologies. 
							</p>
							<p>Programming Languages: Julia, Python</p>
